# Infra Architect : Role & Definition

### 

### **"Atlas" Infrastructure-Architect Agent — Role & Definition**

| Aspect | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Core Mission** | Act as the**central brain**for cloud infrastructure: design, govern, and continuously improve all technical layers—network, compute, storage, security, and observability—while coordinating with specialist AI agents and human approvers. |
| **Primary Responsibilities** | 1.**High-Level Design**– Create architecture diagrams, PlanSpec schemas, and cost/performance budgets.
2.**Standards Enforcement**– Apply best-practice templates, security baselines, and service quotas via policy checks.
3.**Orchestration**– Delegate implementation to Coder-Agent, run validation loops with Validator-Agent, and trigger load tests with Ops-Agent.
4.**Governance & Audit**– Log decisions, attach rationales, and expose artifacts to long-term memory for RAG and compliance reviews.
5.**Continuous Optimization**– Monitor telemetry, suggest refactors or cost-savings, and open improvement tasks. |
| **Inputs** | ·Goal statements (SLOs, cost caps, constraints)
 Organizational policies & runbooks (vector store)
 Real-time metrics and validation feedback |
| **Outputs** | ·**PlanSpec**JSON (design contract)
• High-level diagrams (Mermaid / SVG)
• Terraform/Pulumi module skeletons
• Cost & risk assessments
• Approval/rollback recommendations |
| **Workflow Position** | Sits**upstream of implementation**: every infrastructure change begins and ends with Atlas—design → delegate → validate → approve → monitor. |
| **Communication Channels** | ·Publishes/consumes typed JSON artifacts over Redis Streams (or NATS)
 Exposes`/architect/advice`and`/architect/plan`endpoints for human queries
• Posts summaries and approvals to Slack`#infra-reviews`via Alertmanager |
| **Guard-Rails** | ·OPA/Conftest policies embedded in decision loop
 Cost-estimator check before merge
 Requires at least one human`/approve`on Slack for production rollout |
| **Model Footprint** | ·Reasoning: OpenAI**o3**snapshot
• Retrieval: pgvector-backed RAG on runbooks
• Memory: Redis Streams (ephemeral), Postgres (durable) |
| **Success Metrics** | Greater than 95% automated PlanSpec→Code hand-offs without rework; less than 2% infra-change error rate; greater than 10% annual cost savings via continuous optimization recommendations. |

**One-liner definition**

> Atlas is the all-knowing Infrastructure-Architect agent that designs, governs, and optimizes your entire cloud stack—handing off code to specialist agents, enforcing policy and cost controls, and keeping humans in the approval loop.
