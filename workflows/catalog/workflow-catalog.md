# Alfred Agent Platform Workflow Catalog

This catalog provides a comprehensive overview of all workflows available in the Alfred Agent Platform. The workflows are organized by agent category and include essential information about each workflow's purpose, status, and documentation, as well as migration progress.

## Migration Progress Summary

**Overall Migration Status**: 1% Complete  
**Workflow Documentation Migration**: 1/86 files migrated (1.2%)  
**Highest Priority Workflows**: Niche-Scout, Seed-to-Blueprint (Social Intelligence)  
**Most Fragmented Documentation**: Niche-Scout (9 files), Seed-to-Blueprint (7 files)

## How to Use This Catalog

This catalog serves as a central reference for all workflows in the Alfred Agent Platform. It includes information on workflow purpose, functionality, and implementation status. With the addition of migration information, you can now also track:

- **Migration Status**: Current state of documentation migration (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- **Metadata Compliance**: Whether the workflow documentation includes required metadata (✅ or ❌)
- **Documentation Completeness**: Rating of how complete the documentation is (Low, Medium, High)
- **Migration Priority**: Importance of migrating this workflow's documentation (P0, P1, P2, P3)
  - P0: Critical - Required for system understanding, migrate immediately
  - P1: High - Important for current development, migrate in Phase 2-3
  - P2: Medium - Useful but not blocking, migrate in Phase 4-5
  - P3: Low - Nice to have, migrate in Phase 6 or later

Use this information to understand which workflow documentation is most reliable and to prioritize reviewing or contributing to documentation that needs improvement.

## What are Workflows?

In the Alfred Agent Platform, a workflow is a defined sequence of steps that accomplishes a specific task by orchestrating one or more agents. Workflows can be triggered manually, scheduled, or executed in response to events.

## Workflow Categories

The workflows are organized into the following categories:

- **Social Intelligence Workflows**: Workflows related to social media and content analysis
- **Financial-Tax Workflows**: Workflows related to financial analysis and tax calculations
- **Legal-Compliance Workflows**: Workflows related to legal compliance and document analysis
