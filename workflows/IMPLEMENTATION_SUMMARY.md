# YouTube Workflows Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the YouTube workflows functionality in the Agent Platform, with a focus on the Niche-Scout and Seed-to-Blueprint workflows.

## Recent Updates

### 1. Enhanced Service Health Monitoring

Added robust service health monitoring to the YouTube service API:

```typescript
// Service health status tracker
const serviceStatus: Record<string, ServiceStatus> = {
  socialIntel: {
    available: true,
    lastChecked: new Date()
  }
};

export async function checkServiceHealth(service: 'socialIntel'): Promise<boolean> {
  // Implementation that checks if service is available
}

export function getServiceStatus(service: 'socialIntel'): ServiceStatus {
  // Returns current service status with automatic refresh
}
```

This enables real-time monitoring of backend service availability.

### 2. Enhanced YouTube Service API

Significantly improved the YouTube service API with offline mode support and better error handling:

```typescript
export async function runNicheScout(config: {
  category: string;
  subcategory: string;
  budget?: number;
  dataSources?: Record<string, any>;
  forceOfflineMode?: boolean;
}): Promise<NicheScoutResult> {
  // Implementation with offline mode and error handling
}
```

Key improvements:
- Added timeout handling for API requests
- Implemented offline mode operation when services are unavailable
- Enhanced error detection and reporting
- Added graceful degradation to offline mode
- Improved result status reporting

### 3. Updated UI Components

#### WorkflowCard Component

Enhanced the `WorkflowCard` component with:
- Service health status indicators
- Offline mode visual alerts
- Improved error handling
- Automatic service health checking
- Clear user messaging for service status

#### SocialIntelWorkflowsView Component

Updated to:
- Use actual API services instead of simulated functions
- Display service health status
- Support offline mode operation
- Provide detailed error reporting
- Automatically recover when services become available

## Testing Instructions

### Testing Workflow Functionality

To test the basic workflow functionality:

1. Start the agent-orchestrator service:
   ```
   cd services/agent-orchestrator
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Workflows page

3. Find the "Niche-Scout" workflow card and click "Configure Analysis"

4. Complete the wizard steps:
   - Step 1: Select a main category
   - Step 2: Select a subcategory
   - Step 3: Configure budget and data sources

5. Submit the form and verify that:
   - Loading state is shown during API call
   - Success notification appears on completion
   - Trending niches appear in the results
   - Results are stored and can be viewed through the results dialog

### Testing Service Health and Offline Mode

To test service health monitoring and offline mode:

1. Start the agent-orchestrator service with the backend running:
   ```
   cd /home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2
   docker-compose up -d social-intel redis qdrant
   cd services/agent-orchestrator
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Workflows page and verify:
   - Service health indicator shows "Connected" status (green wifi icon)
   - Normal operation of workflows

3. Stop the backend services:
   ```
   cd /home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2
   docker-compose stop social-intel
   ```

4. Reload the page and verify:
   - Service health indicator shows "Unavailable" status (amber/yellow wifi-off icon)
   - Offline mode banner is displayed
   - Workflow buttons indicate "Run in Offline Mode"

5. Run a workflow and verify:
   - "Service unavailable" notification appears
   - Workflow runs with simulated data in offline mode
   - Results still appear and can be viewed
   - "Offline Mode" indicator appears in the result

6. Restart the backend services:
   ```
   cd /home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2
   docker-compose start social-intel
   ```

7. Wait 60 seconds (or reload the page) and verify:
   - Service health indicator changes back to "Connected" status
   - Offline mode banner disappears
   - Normal operation is restored automatically

### Configuration Options

- For forced offline mode testing, set `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=true` in .env
- For testing with actual services, ensure backend services are running and set `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false`
- Adjust timeouts by modifying AbortSignal.timeout values in youtube-service.ts

## Implementation Notes

- The UI now provides clear visual indicators of service status
- Offline mode allows continued operation when backend services are unavailable
- Automatic recovery when services become available improves user experience
- Enhanced error handling provides meaningful error messages
- Service health is checked periodically to update status automatically
- All components are responsive and handle loading/error states properly
