## Dependencies & Critical Path

The following dependencies represent the critical path for the project:

1. **Data Collection → Analytics Engine**
   - Analytics requires processed data
   - Blocked by data pipeline completion

2. **Analytics Engine → API Layer**
   - API endpoints rely on analytics capabilities
   - Blocked by core analytics implementation

3. **API Layer → Frontend**
   - Dashboard requires functional API endpoints
   - Blocked by API implementation and testing

## Resource Allocation

| Team | Week 1-2 | Week 3-4 | Week 5-6 | Week 7-8 |
|------|---------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Backend** | Data Pipeline | Analytics Engine | API Layer | Support |
| **Data Science** | Data Models | ML Models | Optimization | Calibration |
| **Frontend** | Planning | Component Design | Dashboard | Refinement |
| **QA** | Test Planning | Pipeline Testing | API Testing | E2E Testing |
| **DevOps** | Env Setup | Monitoring | Performance | Deployment |

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data pipeline performance issues | High | Medium | Early performance testing, optimization sprints |
| ML model accuracy below target | High | Medium | Fallback to rule-based approach if needed |
| API latency above threshold | High | Low | Performance optimization focus in Week 5 |
| Integration delays with platform | Medium | Medium | Clear API contracts, mock endpoints |
| Frontend complexity underestimated | Medium | Medium | Component-based approach, early prototyping |
| Last-minute security issues | High | Low | Security reviews in each phase |

## Progress Tracking
