# AI Integration Guidelines for Documentation

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-10  
**Owner:** Documentation Team  
**Status:** Active

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for effectively using AI tools such as Claude and ChatGPT to create, maintain, and review documentation for the Alfred Agent Platform v2. These guidelines ensure consistent, high-quality documentation that aligns with the platform's technical architecture, while maintaining appropriate human oversight.

## Core Principles

1. **Architecture Alignment**: All AI-generated documentation must accurately reflect the Alfred Agent Platform v2 architecture (Supabase, Pub/Sub, LangChain, etc.)
2. **Technical Accuracy**: Human review is required to verify technical correctness of AI-generated content
3. **Consistency**: AI tools should maintain the established documentation standards and terminology
4. **Attribution**: Documentation created with AI assistance should be appropriately tracked
5. **Efficiency**: AI tools should enhance, not replace, human expertise in documentation processes

## Troubleshooting AI Documentation Challenges

### Common Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Cause | Solution |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Technical Inaccuracies** | AI lacks context on recent platform changes | Provide up-to-date technical briefs in prompts, implement human technical review |
| **Inconsistent Terminology** | AI mixing terms from different contexts | Provide glossary of platform-specific terms, use consistent terminology in prompts |
| **Generic Content** | Insufficient specificity in prompts | Include more detailed technical context, request platform-specific implementation details |
| **Missing Platform Context** | AI not aware of architectural decisions | Explicitly include architectural principles and patterns in prompts |
| **Outdated References** | AI trained on older information | Specify current version details, correct any outdated references during review |
| **Hallucinated API Details** | AI generating plausible but incorrect APIs | Always verify API references against actual implementation, include code examples in prompts |

### Improving AI Documentation Quality

1. **Iteration Process**: 
   - Generate initial draft
   - Review for issues
   - Provide specific feedback on problems
   - Request targeted improvements rather than complete regeneration

2. **Context Enhancement**:
   - Keep a library of validated technical descriptions
   - Include code snippets from actual implementation
   - Reference architectural diagrams and data flow models
   - Link to source code repositories for technical accuracy

3. **Specialized Review Checklist**:
   - Architecture alignment verification
   - Terminology consistency check
   - Technical feasibility assessment
   - Implementation accuracy validation
   - Cross-reference validation

## Maintenance and Updates

### Using AI for Documentation Maintenance

- **Change Detection**: Use AI to analyze code changes and suggest documentation updates
- **Consistency Validation**: Periodically review documentation against architecture changes
- **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing or incomplete documentation areas
- **Update Generation**: Generate draft updates based on technical changes

### Documentation Refresh Prompt
