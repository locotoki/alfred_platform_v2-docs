# System Architecture

## Overview

The Alfred Agent Platform follows an event-driven microservices architecture designed for scalability, reliability, and extensibility.

## Core Components

### Message Bus (Pub/Sub)
- Event-driven communication between services
- Guaranteed message delivery
- Dead letter queue for failed messages
- Exactly-once processing guarantee

### State Management (Supabase)
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- pgvector for vector search capabilities
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Row-level security for data protection

### Agent Framework
- LangChain for AI capabilities
- LangGraph for complex workflows
- Standardized agent interface
- Plugin architecture for extensions

### Vector Search (Qdrant)
- High-performance vector similarity search
- Scalable to billions of vectors
- Real-time indexing
- Multi-tenant support

## Data Flow

1. **Request Ingestion**
   - Slack command or API call
   - Create A2A envelope
   - Publish to Pub/Sub

2. **Task Processing**
   - Agent subscribes to relevant intents
   - Process task with AI capabilities
   - Store results in Supabase

3. **Result Delivery**
   - Publish completion event
   - Update UI in real-time
   - Send notifications

## Security

- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting per user
- PII scrubbing in middleware
- TLS encryption in transit
- Encrypted storage at rest

## Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of agents
- Database connection pooling
- Caching with Redis
- Load balancing with health checks

## Monitoring

- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards
- Alert rules for SLA compliance
- Distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
