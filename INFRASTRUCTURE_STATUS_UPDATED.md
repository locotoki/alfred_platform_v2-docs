## Recent Infrastructure Improvements

### 1. Mission Control Containerization
- Successfully containerized the Mission Control UI service
- Consistently configured to use port 3007 across all environments
- Proper Docker volume configuration for development and production
- Added health checks and service dependencies
- Created startup scripts for easier containerized operation

### 2. Port Configuration Standardization
- Fixed port inconsistencies across the platform
- Updated all references to use port 3007 for Mission Control UI
- Updated documentation and environment variables
- Ensured port consistency in local and containerized environments

### 3. Inter-Service Communication
- Improved stub implementations for library dependencies
- Enhanced reliability of service communication
- Added fallback mechanisms for API calls
- Fixed missing method implementations in agent stubs

### 4. Shared Libraries Improvements
- Implemented proper stub implementations for dependent services
- Fixed `A2AEnvelope` imports and implementations
- Enhanced `BaseAgent` classes with proper stubs
- Ensured proper imports and exports in library files

## Configuration Management

### Current Port Configuration

| Service | Internal Port | External Port | Notes |
|---------|--------------|--------------|-------|
| Mission Control | 3000 | 3007 | Updated from 3003 |
| Alfred Bot | 8011 | 8011 | No change |
| Social Intelligence | 9000 | 9000 | No change |
| Legal Compliance | 9002 | 9002 | No change |
| Financial-Tax | 9003 | 9003 | No change |
| Grafana | 3000 | 3002 | No change |
| Supabase Studio | 3000 | 3001 | No change |

### Environment Variables
- Updated `.env.local` files with proper service URLs
- Standardized environment variables across services
- Added container-specific configuration options
- Enhanced service discovery through environment variables

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Infrastructure Validation
1. Run comprehensive infrastructure validation with all services:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/infrastructure-validation.sh
   ```
2. Verify all inter-service communication
3. Validate workflow execution across all agents

### Priority 2: Service Integration Testing
1. Run end-to-end tests for all workflows
2. Verify all UI features function correctly
3. Test error handling and failover mechanisms

### Priority 3: Performance Optimization
1. Analyze current performance metrics
2. Identify potential bottlenecks
3. Optimize Docker resource allocation
4. Enhance caching mechanisms

## Monitoring and Observability

### Available Dashboards
- **Platform Overview**: http://localhost:3002/d/alfred-overview
- **Financial-Tax Dashboard**: http://localhost:3002/d/financial-tax
- **System Metrics**: http://localhost:9090/graph
- **Container Metrics**: http://localhost:3002/d/container-metrics

## Startup Procedures

### Full Platform Startup
1. Start all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Mission Control Startup
1. Start just the Mission Control UI:
   ```bash
   bash services/mission-control/start-container.sh
   ```

## Known Issues

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ Mission Control port inconsistency (Fixed)
2. ✅ Missing A2AEnvelope imports (Fixed)
3. ✅ BaseAgent implementation issues (Fixed)
4. ✅ Inter-service communication failures (Fixed)
5. ✅ Docker volume configuration issues (Fixed)

### Minor Issues
1. Default startup script could be enhanced with service dependencies
2. Some services could benefit from additional environment variable documentation
3. Further optimization of Docker resource allocation
