# Mission Control UI Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the Mission Control UI to be implemented in Phase 6 of the Alfred Agent Platform v2 project.

## Overview

The Mission Control UI will provide a centralized dashboard for monitoring and managing the Alfred Agent Platform. It will focus on business-oriented metrics and task management, complementing the technical monitoring provided by Grafana dashboards.

## Core Requirements

### 1. User Interface

- **Technology Stack**:
  - Next.js for frontend framework
  - React for component architecture
  - Supabase Auth for authentication
  - Supabase Realtime for WebSocket connections
  - TailwindCSS for styling

- **Key Features**:
  - Responsive design that works on desktop and tablet devices
  - Dark/light mode support
  - Accessible interface adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### 2. Real-Time Monitoring

- **Agent Status Dashboard**:
  - Real-time visualization of all agent health statuses
  - Key metrics for each agent (success rate, processing rate)
  - Historical trend visualization

- **Task Monitoring**:
  - Real-time list of active tasks
  - Task details panel showing current task state
  - Task history with filtering capabilities
  - Visual representation of task flow between agents

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

- **User Management**:
  - Integration with Supabase Auth
  - Role-based access control
  - Admin, operator, and view-only user roles

- **Security Features**:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Session management
  - Access logs and audit trails

### 4. Task Management

- **Task Operations**:
  - Create new tasks through the UI
  - Retry failed tasks
  - Cancel active tasks
  - View detailed task logs and outputs

- **Workflow Visualization**:
  - Graphical representation of task flow between agents
  - Timeline view of task progression
  - Detailed task state transitions

### 5. Alerting & Notifications

- **Alert Configuration**:
  - Create and manage alert rules through UI
  - Configure notification channels
  - Set severity levels

- **Notification Delivery**:
  - In-app notifications
  - Email notifications
  - Slack integration

### 6. Reporting

- **Dashboard Reporting**:
  - Success rate by agent and intent
  - Processing time averages
  - Volume metrics

- **Export Capabilities**:
  - CSV export of task data
  - PDF export of dashboards
  - Scheduled report generation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Integration

- Connect to Supabase using the Supabase JS client
- Use Supabase Realtime for WebSocket connections to get live updates
- Implement middleware for authentication and authorization
- Create API endpoints for task operations

### Frontend Components

- Implement reusable dashboard components
- Create visualization components for metrics and task flows
- Develop forms for task creation and management
- Build user management interfaces

### Data Flow

- Supabase Realtime channels for live updates
- REST API endpoints for CRUD operations
- WebSockets for real-time metrics

## Metrics to Display

The Mission Control UI should focus on business-relevant metrics rather than duplicating system metrics already shown in Grafana:

- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of tasks completed successfully
- **Intent Distribution**: Breakdown of tasks by intent type
- **Agent Utilization**: How busy each agent is
- **Processing Time**: How long tasks take to complete
- **Error Rates**: Frequency of different error types

## Integration with Existing Systems

- Pull agent metadata from Supabase database
- Use authentication from Supabase Auth
- Connect to Prometheus for historical metrics
- Interface with Pub/Sub for task commands

## Deployment and Infrastructure

- Containerized deployment with Docker
- Integration with existing docker-compose setup
- Nginx for serving static assets
- Environment configuration for different deployment targets

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for Supabase interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Accessibility testing

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All agents visible with real-time status updates
2. Tasks can be created, monitored, and managed
3. Authentication works with proper role-based access
4. Real-time updates appear without page refresh
5. Reports can be generated and exported
6. UI is responsive and accessible
7. Task flow visualization correctly shows dependencies

## Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 6)

- Mobile application
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- ML-powered anomaly detection
- Predictive task scheduling
- Custom dashboard builder
