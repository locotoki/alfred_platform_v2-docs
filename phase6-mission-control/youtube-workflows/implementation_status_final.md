# YouTube Workflows Integration: Implementation Status

## Status Overview
- **Completion Status:** âœ… Complete
- **Port Configuration:** Standardized (Mission Control: 3007, Social Intelligence Agent: 9000)
- **Documentation:** Updated to reflect current implementation

## Port Configuration
To address recurring port conflicts in the 3000-3005 range, we've standardized on port 3007 for the Mission Control UI while maintaining port 9000 for the Social Intelligence Agent. All configuration files and documentation have been updated accordingly:

1. `package.json`: Using port 3007 for both dev and start scripts
2. `.env.local`: Contains proper URL configurations
3. `next.config.js`: Updated server runtime configuration for port 3007
4. `PORT-STANDARD.md`: Created as the authoritative reference for port standards

## API Integration
The YouTube workflows API integration has been implemented with robust error handling and dynamic URL resolution:

1. Service layer uses `window.location.origin` to dynamically detect the current server
2. Multiple endpoint paths are tried in sequence for better resilience
3. Proper error handling with graceful fallback to mock data
4. Timeout handling to prevent requests from hanging

## UI Implementation
Both workflow UIs have been fully implemented with:

1. Multi-step forms with validation
2. Loading states and error handling
3. Result visualization options
4. Mock data support when API is unavailable

## Testing & Validation
The implementation has been tested under various conditions:

1. With Social Intelligence Agent running
2. With Social Intelligence Agent stopped (mock data fallback)
3. Across different port configurations
4. With the environment check script

## Key Files

### Configuration
- `services/mission-control/package.json`: Port configuration for Next.js
- `services/mission-control/.env.local`: Environment variables
- `services/mission-control/next.config.js`: Server configuration
- `PORT-STANDARD.md`: Port standards documentation

### API Integration
- `services/mission-control/src/services/youtube-workflows.ts`: Core service
- `services/mission-control/src/pages/api/social-intel/*.ts`: API endpoints

### UI Components
- `services/mission-control/src/pages/workflows/niche-scout/*.tsx`: Niche Scout UI
- `services/mission-control/src/pages/workflows/seed-to-blueprint/*.tsx`: Blueprint UI

### Types
- `services/mission-control/src/types/youtube-workflows.ts`: TypeScript definitions

## Known Limitations
1. The mockup data is not as comprehensive as real API responses
2. Visualization options are currently limited to basic charts
3. No caching mechanism for expensive API calls

## Future Improvements
1. Enhance visualization options for workflow results
2. Add request caching for better performance
3. Implement more robust error recovery mechanisms
4. Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Deployment Notes
When deploying to production or other environments, make sure to:

1. Verify the port configuration in package.json and .env.local
2. Ensure the Social Intelligence Agent is running on port 9000
3. Run the environment check script to validate configuration
4. Update any absolute URLs in the code to use dynamic origin detection
