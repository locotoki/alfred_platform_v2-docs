# Documentation Migration Plan

*Last Updated: 2025-05-10*  
*Owner: Documentation Team*  
*Status: Planned*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to consolidate all scattered documentation throughout the Alfred Agent Platform v2 project into the new documentation system structure. The migration will ensure all information is properly organized, accessible, and follows the established documentation principles of "Single Source of Truth" while eliminating duplication and inconsistencies.

## 1. Current State Analysis

### 1.1 Documentation Location Analysis

We have identified the following documentation sources that need consolidation:

1. **Main Documentation Directory**: `/home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/docs/`
   - Already organized with a defined structure but contains some files that don't follow the new organization system
   - Contains subdirectories for agents, workflows, architecture, etc.

2. **Project Root Documentation**: `/home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/*.md`
   - README.md - Main project overview and setup instructions
   - CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guidelines
   - SECURITY.md - Security policies
   - Various implementation files (UI-MIGRATION-*.md, CONTAINERIZATION-*.md)

3. **External Documentation**: `/home/locotoki/docs/`
   - Project plans and design guides
   - System design documents

4. **Service-Specific Documentation**: 
   - In various service directories like `/services/agent-orchestrator/docs/`
   - Individual README files in subdirectories

5. **Staging Area Content**: 
   - Large number of documents in `/docs/staging-area/` that need proper categorization

### 1.2 Documentation Format Analysis

- Most documentation is in Markdown format
- Some files have inconsistent heading structures and formatting
- Some documents contain duplicated information
- Several files lack proper metadata (last updated date, owner, status)

### 1.3 Key Documentation Gaps

1. Missing cross-references between related documents
2. Inconsistent document structure and formatting
3. Outdated information in some technical documents
4. Duplicate information across different files
5. Poor discoverability of important information

## 2. Target State Documentation Structure

We will consolidate all documentation into the structure defined in `documentation-system-summary.md`:

```
/docs
├── agents/                  # Agent documentation
│   ├── catalog/             # Agent catalog and index
│   └── guides/              # Implementation guides
