# AI Agent Platform v2 - Master Project Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-10  
**Owner:** Platform Engineering Team  
**Status:** Active

## Overview

The AI Agent Platform v2 is a comprehensive rearchitecting of the Alfred Agent Platform to create a modular, event-driven system leveraging Supabase for state storage and Pub/Sub for messaging. This platform provides a scalable foundation for implementing and orchestrating intelligent AI agents that can collaborate on complex tasks.

The project started in January 2025 and aims for completion by June 2025, with multiple phases covering infrastructure setup, core library development, and implementation of various specialized agents. The platform is designed to be cloud-native and horizontally scalable, with a focus on security, observability, and extensibility.
