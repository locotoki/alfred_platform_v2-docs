# Conductor

## Overview
**Category:** Core  
**Status:** Planned  
**Tier:** System  
**Description:** The orchestrator agent responsible for routing artifacts, maintaining state machines, and monitoring agent heartbeats across the platform.

## Core Functionality
- Routes artifacts between agents and services
- Maintains workflow state machines
- Monitors agent heartbeats for system health
- Handles retry logic and failure recovery
- Orchestrates complex multi-agent workflows
- Provides real-time status monitoring

## Input/Output Specifications
**Input Types:**
- Workflow definitions: YAML configuration of agent interactions
- State transition events: Signals for workflow progression
- Agent heartbeats: Health status signals
- Artifact references: Pointers to data objects

**Output Types:**
- Workflow status updates: Real-time state information
- Agent dispatch instructions: Task assignments
- System health metrics: Overall platform status
- Event logs: Detailed operation records

## Tools and API Integrations
- Message bus: For inter-agent communication
- State store: For workflow state persistence
- Metrics collector: For system health monitoring
- Logger: For audit and debugging

## Configuration Options
| Option | Description | Default | Required |
|--------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Heartbeat Interval | Time between agent health checks (seconds) | 30 | Yes |
| State Persistence | Enable persistent workflow state | True | Yes |
| Retry Limit | Maximum number of task retries | 3 | No |
| Workflow Timeout | Maximum workflow runtime (minutes) | 60 | No |
| Concurrency Limit | Maximum parallel workflows | 10 | No |

## Metrics and Performance Indicators
- Workflow completion rate: Percentage of workflows completing successfully (target: >99%)
- Average workflow latency: Time from start to completion (target: <10 minutes)
- Agent health rate: Percentage of agents responding to heartbeats (target: 100%)
- Message processing rate: Number of messages processed per second (target: >100/s)
- Recovery effectiveness: Percentage of failures successfully recovered (target: >90%)

## Example Use Cases
### Use Case 1: Multi-Agent Content Analysis
Orchestrating a content analysis workflow involving multiple specialized agents.

```
Workflow Definition:
1. Social Intelligence Agent analyzes trending topics
2. Niche-Scout evaluates opportunity scores
3. Seed-to-Blueprint generates content strategy

Conductor responsibilities:
- Trigger each agent in sequence
- Pass artifacts between steps
- Handle timeout/retry if any agent fails
- Maintain workflow state
- Deliver final results to user
```

### Use Case 2: System Health Management
Monitoring system health and responding to agent failures.

```
Continuous monitoring:
- Collect heartbeats from all active agents
- Detect missing heartbeats or error conditions
- Attempt agent restart or failover
- Alert administrators for persistent issues
- Update system health dashboard
```

## Design Notes
The Conductor is a stateful service implementing the mediator pattern. It maintains knowledge of all active workflows and their current states while delegating actual task execution to specialized agents. The architecture uses a hybrid approach combining event-driven messaging for real-time responsiveness with periodic polling for reliability.

The state machine implementation uses a formalized DSL for workflow definitions, allowing for declarative specification of complex workflow logic including branching, parallelism, and conditional execution.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement predictive failure detection
- Add visual workflow builder interface
- Support dynamic workflow modification during execution
- Implement distributed tracing for cross-agent operations
- Add smart load balancing based on agent performance metrics

## Security and Compliance Considerations
- End-to-end workflow encryption
- Role-based access control for workflow operations
- Complete audit logging of all state transitions
- Secure credential handling for agent authentication
- Compliance with SOC2 requirements for system operations
