# Interfaces initial infra assessment

## 1 Overall impression

You already finished most of the hard groundwork:

- **Core infra, libraries, CI/CD and three production-grade agents** are live.
- Observability, test automation and documentation are well above the usual “MVP” quality bar.
- Your timeline still shows two high-risk blocks before June 2025:
    1. **Financial-Tax Agent (current sprint).**
    2. **Mission Control UI** (4-week chunk after that).

With the foundation this mature, hitting the June target looks realistic—**if** the Financial-Tax sprint stays tightly scoped.

## 2 Financial-Tax Agent — focus checklist

| Area | Why it matters | “Good-enough” scope for 2-week sprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data sources** | LLM chains are only as good as the ledgers you feed them. | Pick **one** accounting source (e.g. QuickBooks or Xero) **and** one tax API (e.g. Avalara sandbox). Stub everything else. |
| **Core chains** | You listed “financial analysis chains”. Clarify which. | *Minimum*: cash-flow summary, expense categorisation, quarterly-tax ETA. |
| **Tax compliance rules** | Jurisdictions explode complexity. | Support **one region** first (Portugal PT + EU VAT). Use config files so other regions can be toggled on later. |
| **Pub/Sub topics** | Must not spam other agents. | Create `financial.tx.summary` (weekly) and `financial.alert.tax_due` (event driven). |
| **Security** | Financial data is the crown jewels. | Encrypt at rest in Supabase (use pgcrypto); add field-level RLS (row-level-security) policies. |
| **Tests** | Target is 90 %+. | Focus on deterministic unit tests for parsing and rule evaluation; integration tests can be fewer but cover happy path. |

**Action:** draft a short “Financial-Tax Agent Definition of Done” shared at the next Monday dev-sync. Keep it to one A4 page; this forces everyone to agree on what *out-of-scope* really means.

## 3 Mission Control UI — early prep

Although Phase 6 only starts after the Financial-Tax agent, a little groundwork now avoids surprises:

1. **Design tokens & component library**
    
    *Pick Tailwind with shadcn/ui (you already used this stack for Alfred dashboards).*
    
2. **Realtime layer**
    
    You already have Supabase Realtime. Verify that **change-feeds** for Qdrant and Redis metrics can be proxied through the same channel, or decide to pipe them into Prometheus/Grafana instead.
    
3. **Wireframe**
    
    One page per topic is enough for v1:
    
    *Agents list*, *Message queue*, *DB health*, *Audit log*.
    

Capture these as Figma frames now; development will go faster.

## 4 Metrics & quality gates

Current numbers:

| Metric | Target | Current | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Uptime** | 99.9 % | 99.92 % | Good – keep weekly chaos test. |
| **API p95 latency** | < 200 ms | 186 ms | OK; watch Financial agent (heavy queries). |
| **Test coverage** | > 90 % | 89 % | Regression from Storage fixes; raise again. |
| **Docs completeness** | 100 % | 85 % | Add sequence diagrams for each agent. |
| **Critical vulns** | 0 | 0 | Continue weekly Dependabot review. |

**Quick win:** add a GitHub Actions job that fails if coverage < 90 %. You have tests; make the threshold enforceable.

## 5 Risk table clean-up

Your risk table lost its column borders when pasted (“RiskImpactProbability…”).

Consider re-formatting as Markdown:

```markdown
markdown
CopyEdit
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|
| API dependencies | High | Medium | Retry + circuit breaker | Active |
| Performance issues | Medium | Low | Continuous profiling | Monitoring |
| … |

```

Good risk logs are read weekly; a broken table is never read.

## 6 Dependencies to secure this week

1. **OpenAI API key quota** – The Financial-Tax agent will spike token usage (doc extraction + chain-of-thought). Pre-approve a higher tier or cache aggressively.
2. **Tax compliance sandbox credentials** – Some APIs take days for approval. Request now.
3. **Accounting provider webhook URL** – If you choose QuickBooks, create the dev app and capture client-id/secret today.

## 7 Next concrete actions (ordered)

| Owner | Deadline | Task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tech Lead | **Mon 10:00** | Circulate Financial-Tax *Definition of Done*. |
| Dev team | **Tue EOD** | Scaffold `financial-tax-agent` service (Docker, health, heartbeat). |
| DevOps | **Wed** | Add pgcrypto + RLS policies to Supabase; run migration. |
| QA Lead | **Thu** | Extend test harness for tax rules; baseline coverage check. |
| Project Lead | **Fri** | Update roadmap & risk log; confirm Mission Control UI kick-off date. |

---

### TL;DR

*Foundation is solid.*

Focus the Financial-Tax sprint on **one data source + one jurisdiction**, push coverage back to 90 %, and lock a tight Definition of Done.

Start small design tasks for the Mission Control UI now, so the June finish line stays in sight.
