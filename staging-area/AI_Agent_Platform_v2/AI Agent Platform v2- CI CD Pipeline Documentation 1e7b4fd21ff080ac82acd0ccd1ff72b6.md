- **Artifact Repository**: **Docker Hub** / **GitHub Container Registry**
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Cloud Monitoring**
- **Container Orchestration**: **Kubernetes** (if applicable for large-scale deployment)

---

## **4. Pipeline Stages**

### **4.1. Code Repository & Branching Strategy**

- **Master Branch**: The production-ready branch. Only tested and validated code is merged here.
- **Feature Branches**: Developers create feature branches from the master branch. These branches contain new features or bug fixes.
- **Development Branch**: Merged feature branches are tested in the development environment before being merged into the master branch.

---

### **4.2. Pipeline Stages Overview**

The CI/CD pipeline consists of several key stages, which can be broken down into the following:

### **1. Code Checkout & Preparation**

- **Trigger**: Pipeline is triggered automatically on code changes (push, pull request, or merge) to GitHub or GitLab.
- **Action**:
    - Checkout the latest code from the repository.
    - Set up environment variables (e.g., API keys, secret credentials) securely using tools like **GitHub Secrets** or **GitLab CI/CD Variables**.

### **2. Build Stage**

- **Action**:
    - **Docker Build**: Build the **Docker images** for services (e.g., Alfred Slack Bot, LangChain Agents, etc.).
    - Ensure that the Docker containers are built from the latest version of the code.
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    docker build -t alfred-agent-platform .
    
    ```
    
- **Artifacts**:
    - Generate and push the built Docker images to a registry like **Docker Hub** or **GitHub Container Registry**.

### **3. Testing Stage**

- **Unit Tests**:
    - Run unit tests on each service (e.g., agent logic, database interactions).
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    pytest tests/
    
    ```
    
- **Integration Tests**:
    - Test integration between system components (e.g., interactions between **Alfred Slack Bot** and **Pub/Sub**).
- **API Tests**:
    - Use **Postman** or **Newman** to test API endpoints for task management and Pub/Sub communication.
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    newman run api_tests_collection.json
    
    ```
    
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**:
    - Test the complete flow from **task initiation** to **task completion**, ensuring that agents perform as expected when deployed in the real environment.

### **4. Linting & Code Quality Checks**

- **Action**:
    - Use **Flake8** or **Black** for Python code quality checks.
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    flake8 .
    black --check .
    
    ```
    
- **Linting** for JavaScript or TypeScript (if applicable):
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    eslint .
    
    ```
    
- Ensure that all code adheres to the defined coding standards.

### **5. Build Docker Images and Push to Registry**

- **Action**:
    - If tests pass, the pipeline will build the **Docker images** and push them to the container registry.
    
    ```bash
    bash
    CopyEdit
    docker build -t username/alfred-agent-platform:$GITHUB_SHA .
    docker push username/alfred-agent-platform:$GITHUB_SHA
    
    ```
    

### **6. Deployment Stage**

- **Staging Environment**:
    - Deploy the latest Docker image to a **staging** environment (on **Google Cloud Run**, **AWS ECS**, or **Kubernetes**).
    - Verify that the platform is working in the staging environment, including testing Pub/Sub topics and state storage integration with **Supabase**.
- **Production Environment**:
    - After successful staging validation, deploy the latest code to **production**.
    - Use **Kubernetes** or **Google Cloud Run** to deploy services in the production environment.

### **7. Monitoring & Alerts**

- **Action**:
    - After deployment, **Prometheus** will start collecting metrics for system health and performance.
    - Use **Grafana** dashboards to monitor the platform's status (e.g., task completion rate, system latency, agent performance).
- **Alerts**: Set up alerts for failures in task processing, agent performance issues, or unexpected downtime.
    - Example: Alerts for task failures can be configured to notify via Slack or email.

      - name: Deploy to Production
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'

## **5. Best Practices & Guidelines**

- **Automated Rollback**: In the event of a failed deployment or issue in production, implement automated rollback mechanisms to revert to the previous stable version.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Set up **real-time monitoring** in your staging and production environments, so issues can be detected early and resolved before they affect users.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure that unit tests cover key functionalities like task creation, task status checking, agent workflows, and Pub/Sub communication. Aim for high **test coverage** to guarantee that the platform behaves as expected.
- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that configuration variables (API keys, database credentials, etc.) are kept secure and injected into the environment using **Secrets** in GitHub Actions or **GitLab CI/CD Variables**.
