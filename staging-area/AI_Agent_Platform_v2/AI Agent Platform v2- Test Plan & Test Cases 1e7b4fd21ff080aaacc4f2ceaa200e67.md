# AI  Agent Platform v2- Test Plan & Test Cases

## **1. Overview**

The **Test Plan** outlines the testing strategy, objectives, and test cases for ensuring the **Alfred Agent Platform** functions as expected. It covers the types of testing to be performed, the tools used, and the specific test cases for the various platform components (e.g., agents, Pub/Sub, API endpoints, etc.).

---

## **2. Testing Objectives**

The primary goal is to ensure that:

- **Functional correctness**: All components behave according to the specifications.
- **Integration correctness**: The entire system works cohesively when components interact (e.g., agent communication via Pub/Sub).
- **Performance**: The system can handle the expected load and scale appropriately.
- **Reliability**: The system should handle errors gracefully (e.g., retries, task failure handling).
- **Security**: Ensure sensitive data and operations are secure.

---

## **3. Types of Testing**

### **3.1. Unit Testing**

- **Objective**: Test individual components (e.g., agent logic, utility functions, API helpers) to ensure they work in isolation.
- **Tools**: **pytest**, **unittest**.
- **Scope**: Each agentâ€™s logic (e.g., **SocialIntelligenceAgent**, **LegalComplianceAgent**), helper functions, Pub/Sub message formatting, and error handling.

**Examples of Unit Tests**:

- **Agent Logic**: Test if **LangChain** workflows produce the correct outputs.
    - Input: Data for analysis.
    - Expected Output: Correctly formatted summary, trends, or analysis results.
- **Pub/Sub Messaging**: Test if tasks are correctly formatted and published to Pub/Sub.
    - Input: Task data (e.g., `intent: TREND_ANALYSIS`).
    - Expected Output: Correct task envelope is published.

---

### **3.2. Integration Testing**

- **Objective**: Test interactions between components to ensure they work together (e.g., interaction between **Alfred** Slack bot and **Pub/Sub**, **Supabase** storage).
- **Tools**: **pytest**, **mock**, **requests**.
- **Scope**: Interaction between **Slack**, **Pub/Sub**, **Supabase**, **Qdrant**, and **LangChain** agents.

**Examples of Integration Tests**:

- **Task Creation**: Ensure tasks published to Pub/Sub are correctly processed by agents.
    - Input: `a2a.tasks.create` task.
    - Expected Output: Task is received by the correct agent and processed.
- **State Storage**: Verify that task results are correctly stored in **Supabase** and retrievable via API endpoints.
    - Input: Completed task.
    - Expected Output: Task result is stored and can be retrieved via the `/tasks/{task_id}/results` API.

---

### **3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

- **Objective**: Ensure the full system works as expected, from task initiation to completion.
- **Tools**: **Selenium**, **Cypress**, **Postman**, **pytest**.
- **Scope**: Complete task lifecycle, including task creation, agent processing, data storage, and result retrieval.

**Examples of E2E Tests**:

- **Task Lifecycle**: Ensure a task can be created via **Slack**, processed by the agent, and results are retrieved via **Supabase**.
    - Input: User command via **Slack** to start a task (e.g., `TREND_ANALYSIS`).
    - Expected Output: Task is processed, result is stored, and updated status is visible in the UI.
- **Real-time Updates**: Test that **Supabase Realtime** pushes updates to the UI as task statuses change.
    - Input: Task status changes (e.g., from `processing` to `completed`).
    - Expected Output: Real-time update to **Mission Control UI**.

---

### **3.4. Load Testing**

- **Objective**: Ensure the system can handle the expected load and scale appropriately.
- **Tools**: **Locust**, **Apache JMeter**.
- **Scope**: Simulate multiple tasks being processed simultaneously.

**Example of Load Test**:

- **Task Processing Load**: Simulate 1,000 simultaneous task requests.
    - Input: 1,000 tasks published to Pub/Sub.
    - Expected Output: System processes tasks efficiently without errors or significant delays.

---

### **3.5. Security Testing**

- **Objective**: Ensure the system is secure from common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
- **Tools**: **OWASP ZAP**, **Burp Suite**.
- **Scope**: Security checks on API endpoints, authentication flows, and data storage.

**Examples of Security Tests**:

- **API Security**: Ensure sensitive endpoints (e.g., task creation, task results retrieval) are protected by proper authentication.
    - Input: Unauthenticated request to access task results.
    - Expected Output: Access denied with a 401 Unauthorized response.
- **Data Encryption**: Test that sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

---

## **4. Test Cases**

### **Test Case 1: Task Creation**

- **Objective**: Verify that a task is correctly created and published.
- **Steps**:
    1. Trigger task creation via **Slack**.
    2. Verify that a task is published to **Pub/Sub** with the correct **task_id** and **intent**.
- **Expected Result**: Task is published with the correct task envelope schema.

### **Test Case 2: Agent Processing**

- **Objective**: Ensure that the agent correctly processes the task.
- **Steps**:
    1. Agent subscribes to `a2a.tasks.create`.
    2. Agent processes the task and updates the task status.
- **Expected Result**: Task status is updated correctly in **Supabase** and results are generated.

### **Test Case 3: Task Result Retrieval**

- **Objective**: Verify that task results can be retrieved.
- **Steps**:
    1. Retrieve task results using the `/tasks/{task_id}/results` endpoint.
- **Expected Result**: Task results are returned correctly, including any output data.

## **10. Operations & Maintenance Guide**

### **1. Overview**

The **Operations & Maintenance Guide** provides best practices and procedures for ensuring the continued smooth operation of the **Alfred Agent Platform**. It covers monitoring, troubleshooting, scaling, backups, and handling incidents.

---

### **2. Monitoring & Alerting**

### **2.1. Monitoring Tools**

- **Prometheus**: Monitors system health, task processing times, error rates, and resource usage (CPU, memory).
- **Grafana**: Visualizes data collected from Prometheus, providing dashboards for performance metrics.
- **Google Cloud Monitoring**: Monitors cloud infrastructure performance (e.g., **Google Cloud Run** services).

### **2.2. Alerts**

- Set up alerts for:
    - Task failures (e.g., tasks that fail after retry attempts).
    - System resource issues (e.g., high CPU/memory usage).
    - Task processing time thresholds (e.g., tasks taking too long).

---

### **3. Scaling**

### **3.1. Horizontal Scaling**

- **Microservices**: Use **Kubernetes** or **Google Cloud Run** for auto-scaling services (agents, API).
- **Pub/Sub**: Automatically scales with message volume, ensuring message delivery to agents without bottlenecks.

### **3.2. Database Scaling**

- **Supabase**: Scale Postgres database horizontally (using read replicas or partitioning) to handle high volumes of state storage.
- **Qdrant**: Scale vector search using **Qdrant** clusters.

---

### **4. Backups & Data Recovery**

### **4.1. Regular Backups**

- Schedule automated backups for the **Postgres database** (Supabase) and **Qdrant** vector store.
- Store backups off-site (e.g., cloud storage) to ensure data redundancy.

### **4.2. Disaster Recovery**

- Implement disaster recovery procedures to restore system operations in case of data loss or system failures.
- Ensure a **rollback mechanism** for database migrations or failed deployments.

---

### **5. Troubleshooting & Incident Management**

### **5.1. Logs & Diagnostics**

- **Google Cloud Logging**: Collect logs from all services (agents, API, Pub/Sub) for debugging.
- **LangSmith**: Use LangSmith for debugging agent workflows and tracing task processing issues.

### **5.2. Incident Response**

- Set up an incident response plan for handling system outages, task processing failures, or security breaches. This includes:
    - Identifying the root cause.
    - Restoring service and mitigating damage.
    - Post-incident review to improve system reliability.
