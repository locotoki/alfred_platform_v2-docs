# Social Intel Agent :  “try-it-tomorrow” exercises

Below are “try-it-tomorrow” exercises that map to the major capabilities in the framework you documented. Each one can be done with off-the-shelf tools or a quick notebook, giving you a feel for the research workflow and surfacing any blind spots early.

### 1 Competitor & Topic Scanner (manual pilot)

| Goal | What to try manually | Why it’s useful |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Validate the **Content Gap Scanner** scoring logic | Pull metadata for 5–10 competitor videos with `yt-dlp --flat-playlist` or the YouTube Data API; drop titles, tags, and your own channel’s catalogue into a Google Sheet; colour-code overlaps and gaps by hand | Confirms the keyword/overlap heuristics before you formalise them in the pipeline |

### 2 Trend Pulse quick-and-dirty

- **Google Trends + YouTube autosuggest**: Paste a seed keyword into both, note the rising queries, and track velocity in a spreadsheet for a week.
- **Ship a Slack reminder** (Zapier or n8n) that pings you each morning with the top new terms.

> Outcome: You’ll see whether the 24 h cadence in the plan is fast enough and which sources add real signal.

### 3 Voice Consistency smoke test

1. Collect 3 finished scripts you’re proud of and 3 you’d like to “sound more on-brand”.
2. Run them through `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` in a Colab notebook.
3. Compute pairwise cosine similarity and eyeball which lines pull the score down.

This reveals whether simple embeddings catch off-tone phrasing before you invest in a bespoke “Voice Checker” service.

### 4 Retention vs Comments correlation

- Export the audience-retention CSV for one high-view video.
- Grab all timestamps mentioned in the comments (Regex for `00:00`).
- Plot retention curve and comment spikes in the same chart (Sheets or Matplotlib).

If you see alignment, the planned **Engagement Pattern Miner** is worth automating; if not, you might pivot the feature.SocialIntel_Agent_FinalSocialIntel_Agent_Final

### 5 Thumbnail / Title micro A/B

Even without full TubeBuddy integration, you can:

1. Upload two unlisted versions of the same video differing only in thumbnail or title.
2. Share both links to a small, demographically similar focus group (Discord, mailing list).
3. Record which variant earns higher click-through and perceived relevance.

A couple of rounds provide training data for your eventual CTR-prediction model.

### 6 One-flow Prefect dry run

Spin up a local Prefect agent and schedule a single task: pull yesterday’s channel stats and dump to Slack/Email. Measure:

- **Reliability** (does it fail silently?)
- **Setup friction** (docker, env secrets)
- **Alerting noise**

That tiny DAG will tell you whether Prefect fits your dev-ops comfort level before you commit to it as the orchestrator.SocialIntel_Agent_FinalSocialIntel_Agent_Final

## How to decide: iterate or dive in?

*If two or three of these pilots surface major surprises—e.g., keywords aren’t predictive, or Prefect feels heavyweight—take a beat and revise the architecture.*

*If, however, the manual experiments feel solid and the pain is just “it’s tedious to do this every day”, that’s your green light to automate.*

### Next step?

Which of these bite-sized tests feels most valuable to run this week? Let me know, and I can send a quick “how-to” notebook or walk-through so you can hit the ground running.
