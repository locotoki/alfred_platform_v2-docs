# Social Intel Agent :  Research‐and-insight workflows

| **#** | **Workflow** | **What it uncovers** | **Why it matters** | **High-leverage twist** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Niche-Scout** | Emerging sub-niches, trending topics, and strategic gaps on YouTube by analyzing categories, views, engagement metrics, and creator payoffs. | Focuses your channel on high-growth or underserved areas—maximizing discovery and early-mover advantage. | Embed-based clustering + competitive gap scoring: automatically surface micro-niches that similar channels haven’t yet explored. |
| 2 | **Seed-to-Blueprint** | Fully fleshed content blueprints from raw “seed” ideas—titles, detailed outlines, hook-to-CTAs flow, recommended formats, and SEO tags. | Dramatically cuts planning time and ensures every video is structured for maximum watch-time, CTR, and keyword ranking. | Generate multiple blueprint variants via LLM “temperature sweeps,” then A/B test small pilot uploads to pick the best-performing outline template. |
| 3 | **Sponsor-Market Pulse** | CPM benchmarks, common sponsor categories, integration formats (pre-roll, mid-roll, demo slots) within your niche. | Enables data-driven sponsor pitches and lets you pre-package “demo slots” at market rates to increase ad revenue. | Auto-scrape “This video is brought to you by…” segments with an LLM, logging brand × channel × format to build your own rate card. |
| 4 | **Audience-Sentiment Miner** | Top themes, claims, and emotional triggers (most-liked vs. most-disliked) from comments and Shorts replies across leading channels. | Refines script angles and thumbnail copy by leaning into “love words” and steering clear of “pain words” that hurt engagement. | Weekly emotion-classification + topic-model clustering dashboard; spike alerts for negative sentiment so you can respond in your next upload. |
| 5 | **Retention Heat-Fingerprinting** | Second-by-second retention curves for 30 benchmarks → clustered “signature patterns” of pacing and structure. | Reveals optimal pacing templates (e.g., rhythmic chorus repeats, timing of hook) that keep audiences glued to the screen. | Use Dynamic Time Warping to auto-label new edits as “high-performer match” before publishing, guiding editors toward the most engaging cuts. |
| 6 | **Cross-Platform Echo Scan** | Which top YouTube videos are also trending on TikTok, Reels, Pinterest, podcasts, etc.—and the lag/lead effect on each platform. | Tells you where to drop first for maximum algorithmic lift and which formats travel best between platforms. | Audio-fingerprint search (e.g., track hashing) to detect unofficial reposts and gauge true organic shareability across networks. |
| 7 | **Seasonality & Event Forecaster** | Year-over-year engagement deltas around holidays, product launches, school calendars, and viral events. | Lets you pre-produce timely content (e.g., “Halloween Song”) exactly six weeks before peak interest to ride the trend wave. | Fuse Google Trends + channel analytics via a Prophet model to auto-generate a `content-calendar.csv` with green-lit production windows. |
| 8 | **Thumbnail DNA Decomposer** | Dominant colour palettes, focal-point layouts, text density vs. CTR metrics across top-performing thumbnails. | Provides a quantitative style guide for designers—moving beyond subjective feedback to data-backed visual benchmarks. | Ingest 1,000 thumbnails into a mini Vision-Transformer → K-means → output five “archetypes” with median CTR; then hybridize the top two for novel designs. |
| 9 | **Multilingual White-Space Finder** | High-volume search keywords and nursery-rhyme titles in Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese (etc.) with low competition in those locales. | Unlocks “copy-once, dub-many” scale by identifying the most lucrative target languages for AI voice-over expansions. | Automate Gap-Finder logic through Google Translate API; report Search-Volume/Competition ratios per language and rank dubbing priorities accordingly. |
