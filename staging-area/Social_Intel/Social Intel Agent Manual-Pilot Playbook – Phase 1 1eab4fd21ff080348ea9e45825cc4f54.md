### Pilot 1‚ÄÇCompetitor & Topic Scanner ‚Äì ‚ÄúGap Finder‚Äù

| Item | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Research Question** | *What high-interest keywords do our competitors rank for that we don‚Äôt?* |
| **Primary Output** | `gaps.csv` sorted by ‚Äúcompetitor count minus our count‚Äù; a short list of video ideas |
| **Time Budget** | 60 min gather  +  30 min colour-code |
| **Tools (choose one)** | **Quick-Copy:** Browser + Google Sheets |
| **Done When** | ‚â•10 orange ‚Äúgap‚Äù keywords and at least 3 ideas you‚Äôre excited to script |

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-Step (Quick-Copy mode)</strong></summary>

1. **List 5 competitor channels** you admire.
2. **Create a Google Sheet** with three tabs: *Competitors*, *Your Channel*, *Keyword Pivot*.
3. **Copy the 20 most-popular video titles** from each competitor (Videos ‚Üí Sort by Popular). Paste into *Competitors* !A.
4. **Paste your own 20 most-popular titles** into *Your Channel* !A.
5. In *Competitors* !C2 type
    
    ```
    php
    CopyEdit
    =ARRAYFORMULA(LOWER(REGEXREPLACE(A2:A,"[^A-Za-z0-9 ]","")))
    
    ```
    
    then in *Competitors* !D2 type
    
    ```
    php
    CopyEdit
    =ARRAYFORMULA(SPLIT(C2:C," "))
    
    ```
    
    (Copy both formulas to *Your Channel*.)
    
6. **Insert a Pivot Table** in *Keyword Pivot* ‚Üí Rows = Keyword, Values = COUNTA (do this twice: one per tab).
7. **Conditional-format** cells where Competitor ‚â•5 **and** You = 0 (bright orange).
8. **Interpret** orange cells ‚Üí brainstorm 3‚Äì5 new video topics.
9. **Log findings** in Notion row (Key Findings + Next Action).

</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-Step (Semi-Tech mode)</strong></summary>

See Appendix B for a ready-made `scan_competitors.py`. Claude can run:

```bash
bash
CopyEdit
yt-dlp --flat-playlist --print "%(title)s" <CHANNEL_URL> > titles.txt
python scan_competitors.py --ours my_titles.txt --theirs titles.txt --out gaps.csv

```

and upload `gaps.csv` to Notion automatically.
