# AI-Agent Crew for Scalable, Fully-Automated Infrastructure

*****Minimal viable crew to start tomorrow*****

- **Atlas** (design) : Next project!
- **Forge** (build & run)
- **Sentinel** (validate)
- **Conductor** (glue)

Everything else can layer on without breaking contracts, because all agents communicate through typed JSON artifacts in the message bus.

### AI-Agent Crew for Scalable, Fully-Automated Infrastructure

*(ordered from “lean pilot” to “large-scale maturity” so you can grow the roster incrementally)*

| Stage | Agent Role & Handle | Core Mandate | Typical Triggers | Key Tools / Skills |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Lean Crew (Day 1)** |  |  |  |  |
| 1 | **Atlas** – *Infrastructure-Architect* | Produce high-level designs, PlanSpec JSON contracts, cost/perf budgets. | New feature brief, capacity spike forecasts, refactor requests. | RAG over patterns KB, diagram generators, cost-modelling. |
| 2 | **Forge** – *Implementation & Ops* | Convert PlanSpec into IaC, run deploy pipelines, day-2 ops (scale, patch, rollback). | PlanSpec arrival, alert fires, nightly drift check. | Terraform/Pulumi, CI/CD runner, k6, Grafana API, incident playbooks. |
| 3 | **Sentinel** – *Validator / Policy Gate* | Static analysis, sandbox “plan-apply-destroy”, OPA / cost checks; either pass or return critique. | MR opened by Forge, nightly policy scan. | tfsec, Conftest, Firecracker sandbox, cost-estimator. |
| 4 | **Conductor** – *Orchestrator Agent* | Route artifacts, manage retries, maintain state machine, heartbeat all agents. | Every artifact event; health-checks. | CrewAI / LangGraph control loops, Redis Streams. |
| **Growth Crew (Day 30-90)** |  |  |  |  |
| 5 | **FinPilot** – *FinOps Optimizer* | Analyse spend vs. budget, recommend rightsizing or RI/SP purchases, open cost-savings PRs. | Daily cost feed, >10 % budget deviation. | Cloud billing APIs, predictive models, cost-anomaly detection. |
| 6 | **Shield** – *SecOps / Compliance* | Monitor CVE feeds, enforce CIS/PCI controls, auto-patch or quarantine resources. | CVE publish, failed compliance scan. | trivy, AWS Inspector, OPA policies, ticket API. |
| 7 | **Observer** – *Telemetry & SLO Keeper* | Own dashboards, alert rules, SLO error budget; trigger auto-scale or escalate to Forge. | Metric breach, SLO burn-rate > threshold. | Prometheus, Grafana provisioning, auto-scaler API. |
| 8 | **Chaosmith** – *Resilience Tester* | Inject faults, run chaos experiments, certify fail-over paths; feed results back to Atlas. | Weekly chaos window, post-incident RCA. | ChaosMesh, Litmus, steady-state hypothesis engine. |
| **Large-Scale Crew (Day 180+)** |  |  |  |  |
| 9 | **DataSteward** – *Data & Storage Ops* | Schema migrations, backup verifications, data-policy compliance, data cost tuning. | New DB PlanSpec, backup drift, GDPR request. | Flyway, snapshot APIs, DLP scanners. |
| 10 | **Synthesist** – *Knowledge Manager* | Curate vector store of runbooks, past RCAs, design rationales; answer “why”. | New artifact, human Q&A query. | pgvector, embeddings pipeline, semantic search. |
| 11 | **Incident Commander** – *AIOps Coordinator* | Correlate multi-signal alerts, manage incident timeline, summarise post-mortems. | Multi-alert burst, Sev-1 flag. | ML-based event correlation, Slack war-room bot, RCA template generator. |
| 12 | **Provisioner** – *Capacity / Fleet Manager* | Manage underlying cluster/fleet, spot-/on-demand balance, hardware lifecycle. | Scaling trend, hardware EOL. | Cluster autoscaler, Bare-metal API, inventory DB. |

### How growth happens

1. **Pilot phase** – **Atlas + Forge + Sentinel** handled via Conductor loop covers ∼80 % of routine work.
2. **Ops heat** drives adding **Observer** and **FinPilot** as cost & SLO pressures appear.
3. **Security / compliance mandates** pull in **Shield**; resilience goals invite **Chaosmith**.
4. **At scale**, specialised data, incident-management and fleet-lifecycle agents round out the crew.

> Note: You can host multiple roles in one process early on and split into independent services as tokens & latency budgets grow.
