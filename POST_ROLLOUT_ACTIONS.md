## Deprecation Notice

> ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT**: The client-side Levenshtein transformation in the Social-Intel proxy will be removed once the upstream service (SI) ships its parameter-aware scorer.

### Transformation Logic to be Removed:

The following components will be deleted after SI-243 is resolved:

1. **File**: `/services/mission-control/src/pages/api/social-intel/proxy-helper.ts`
   - `applyLevenshteinTransformation()` function
   - Associated tests in `/tests/unit/proxy-helper.test.ts`

2. **File**: `/services/mission-control-simplified/integrate-with-social-intel.js`
   - `transformResults()` function at line ~120
   - The related filtering logic in the `/niche-scout` handler

3. **Pull Request**: Create a PR with the following title and branch after upstream fix is deployed:
   ```
   fix: remove client-side Levenshtein transform (SI-243 resolved)
   ```
   Branch: `remove-levenshtein-transform`

### Verification Steps:

Before removing the transformation:
1. Confirm with SI team that parameter-aware scoring is live
2. Verify API returns properly filtered results for the same query/category
3. Run side-by-side comparison to ensure result quality is identical or better
4. Update documentation to reflect the removal of this workaround
