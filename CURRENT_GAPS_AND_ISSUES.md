# Current Gaps and Lingering Issues
> Assessment Date: May 04, 2025

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

### 1. Financial-Tax Service Not Running
- **Status**: Service container not active
- **Required Action**: Build and launch the service
- **Impact**: Core functionality for financial features unavailable

```bash
# Build and run the service
cd services/financial-tax
docker build -t alfred-platform/financial-tax:latest .
docker-compose up -d financial-tax
```

### 2. Missing Python Dependencies in Validation Scripts
- **Issue**: Scripts missing required dependencies (aiohttp, asyncpg, etc.)
- **Impact**: Cannot run automated validation scripts
- **Fix**: Install required dependencies or run scripts inside Docker

```bash
# Option 1: Install dependencies
pip install aiohttp asyncpg python-dotenv structlog

# Option 2: Create a Docker-based validation script
docker run --network=host -v $(pwd):/app python:3.11 pip install -r requirements.txt && python /app/scripts/utils/service_health_check.py
```

### 3. Missing Database Extension: pg_cron
- **Current State**: Not installed despite being in migration scripts
- **Purpose**: Scheduled jobs for cleanup and maintenance
- **Resolution**: Install extension manually

```bash
docker exec supabase-db psql -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;"
```

## ðŸŸ¡ Partial Implementations

### 1. Test Coverage for Financial-Tax Agent
- **Current**: ~70% coverage
- **Target**: 90%+
- **Gap**: Missing edge cases and integration tests

### 2. Monitoring Dashboard Integration
- **Issue**: Financial-Tax service not registered in Prometheus
- **Fix**: Update prometheus.yml and restart

### 3. API Documentation
- **Status**: OpenAPI spec exists but needs endpoint verification
- **Required**: Swagger UI integration and testing

## ðŸŸ¢ Infrastructure Validation Gaps

### Needed Verifications
1. All services health endpoints working
2. Database indexes optimized
3. Message deduplication working
4. Rate limiting functioning
5. PII scrubbing effective

## Priority Action Items

### Week 1 Completion (Infrastructure)
1. [ ] Run full infrastructure validation script
2. [ ] Enable pg_cron extension
3. [ ] Fix Python dependencies for scripts
4. [ ] Verify all health endpoints
5. [ ] Complete service health dashboard

### Week 2 Start (Missing Components)
1. [ ] Implement enhanced rate limiting
2. [ ] Set up distributed tracing
3. [ ] Improve service discovery
4. [ ] Add comprehensive PII patterns

### Week 3 Focus (Financial-Tax Agent)
1. [ ] Deploy Financial-Tax service
2. [ ] Achieve 90% test coverage
3. [ ] Complete integration tests
4. [ ] Performance optimization
5. [ ] Update monitoring dashboards

## Scripts to Run

```bash
# 1. Infrastructure Validation
make infrastructure-check

# 2. Database Validation
make validate-db

# 3. Health Check
make health-check

# 4. Setup Cron Jobs
make setup-cron

# 5. Run Tests
make test-unit test-integration
```

## Deployment Readiness Checklist

### Pre-deployment Requirements
- [ ] All services running and healthy
- [ ] Database migrations complete
- [ ] Test coverage >90%
- [ ] Security scan passed
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Backup procedures tested

### Missing Environmental Variables
```env
# These need to be verified in .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
ANON_KEY=
```

## Architecture Gaps

### 1. Service Discovery
- No automated service registration
- Manual agent registry updates
- Missing health check aggregation

### 2. Error Recovery
- Limited circuit breaker implementation
- No automated failover
- Missing retry policies for external services

### 3. Security Enhancements Needed
- API rate limiting per endpoint
- Enhanced JWT validation
- Request signing for internal services
- Audit logging implementation

## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Immediate (Today)**:
   - Launch Financial-Tax service
   - Fix script dependencies
   - Run full validation suite

2. **Short-term (This Week)**:
   - Complete infrastructure validation
   - Address critical gaps
   - Prepare for Week 2 tasks

3. **Medium-term (Next Week)**:
   - Implement missing components
   - Enhance security features
   - Prepare for production deployment

## Conclusion

While the core infrastructure is largely operational, several critical gaps remain before moving to production. The most urgent is getting the Financial-Tax service running and completing the infrastructure validation phase. With focused effort, these gaps can be addressed within the planned timeline.
