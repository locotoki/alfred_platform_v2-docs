   - Includes Last Updated date
   - Lists Owner (Platform Team)
   - Specifies Status (Active)

2. **Structure:**
   - Follows project template structure
   - Uses appropriate headings and sections
   - Includes all required sections

3. **Formatting:**
   - Uses proper Markdown formatting
   - Code blocks are properly formatted
   - Tables are consistently structured
   - Links are properly formatted

4. **Cross-referencing:**
   - References to related documentation
   - Links to platform components
   - Citations for external resources

## Migration Challenges and Solutions

1. **Challenge:** Original document lacked clear section hierarchy
   **Solution:** Applied consistent heading levels and restructured content

2. **Challenge:** Code examples lacked context and comments
   **Solution:** Enhanced code blocks with improved comments and context

3. **Challenge:** Some sections were missing compared to template
   **Solution:** Added new sections based on template requirements

4. **Challenge:** Inconsistent formatting across document
   **Solution:** Applied uniform formatting styles throughout

5. **Challenge:** Lack of structured data presentation
   **Solution:** Added tables for better organization of information

## Next Steps

1. Replace the original document with the migrated version
2. Update cross-references in other documents
3. Review for technical accuracy with the platform team
4. Incorporate agent implementation feedback based on usage
